### Why Clean code?
Writing Bad code can slow you and your team down during development:
* Adapting new technologies
* re designing project
* adding new features
* adding new people to project

### Rotting code:
Code can rot as time goes by for several reasons in some kind of systems, for example:
* Rigidity: Changing something may force you to make lots of changes in different prats of code.
* Fragility: Changing something may break your program.
* Inseparability: These systems have inseparable modules. it means we have different modules that can not be reused anywhere.
* opacity: Code that is hard to read, understand and hard to change.
* Going fast: Bad programmers(WE)
