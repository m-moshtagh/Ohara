## Comments

### Coding Standards

The Code itself should be the coding standard. everything should be understandable inside the code.

Comments should be rare. They should be where for real programmers need to read it.

> In modern languages "Every Comment is a Failure".

Examples of Good comments:

* Copyright comments
* regex or string format explanation
* todo comments
* legal rights
* public api comments

Good code can also make top choices useless. For example Choosing good short descriptive names for variables and
functions will let us loose from writing useless comments.

## File size & WhiteSpace

Also keeping the file sizes small will make the project much easier to digest. It doesn't matter how large the
project is.

It's great to separate functions from each other and variables with one line. also we can separate Constants, 
functions and variables which have affinity with each other. 

> It's recommended to always prevent horizontal scrolling.

Indentation usage of the team should be the same.

reformatting files should be in small chunks because if we modify the whole file the merges will be nightmare.
