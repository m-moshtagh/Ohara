# Facade Design Pattern

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other
complex set of classes.

## Problem

Imagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that belong to a sophisticated library or
framework. Ordinarily, youâ€™d need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of dependencies, execute methods in the
correct order, and so on.

As a result, the business logic of your classes would become tightly coupled to the implementation details of 3rd-party
classes, making it hard to comprehend and maintain.

## Solution

A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. A
facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes
only those features that clients really care about.
