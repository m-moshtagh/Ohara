# Jshell:
It's a REPL for java language. (Read Eval Print Loop) means it is an interactive programming environment that we can
prototype Java code.
Jshell helps to quickly experience Java code. We can quickly test ideas without need of main method ceremony. We can
also explore APIs. We get code completion and also built-in documentation. It's also a great teaching tool.

# Usage:
We can use Jshell from commandline by typing command jshell. we can quit it using /exit and also get help by /help.
we can type any valid java expression, statement.
NOTE: we can use regex matching directly on a string by following matches() method.
We can see what's imported using /imports. we can also add our own imports.

# Jshell Environment:
We can also interact with outside environment with jshell.
> /save name.jsh ==> saves session to a file. then we can open it by /open command

We can also add jars to classpath and use --classpath option + jar name and use them in snippet.

# Jshell API:
- we can integrate a jshell in our own application
- we can have code completion functionality
- source code analysis
- IDE integration
var jshell = Jshell.create();
List<SnippetEvent> events = jshell.eval("int i = 0;");
Stream<VarSnippet> vars = jshell.variables();
