> After a successful login we need to rotate the session-ID and get a new Session-ID.

In order to persist password in a resource we need to apply hashing algorithms to provide the necessary privacy and
security.

> Also, We need to 2-factor authentication. It doesn't matter if we use one time password or hardware security password.

### IMA

For Authentication Authorization, we can have authentication in every module we write. But also we can connect to
Identity and Access management platform. It is recommended to use this method. Tools we can use:

* KeyCloak/WSO2
* Identity server

These IAM connects to a data source or Database and, we connect to this IAM.
These IAMs also support different mechanisms like LDAP OAUTH2.

In OAUTH2 we get two tokens:

* Access Token
* Refresh Token

We don't need new login if we have valid access token. Or the app can use refresh token to get new access token.
