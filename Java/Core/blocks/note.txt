# Java Code Blocks:
Structures which are used in java code are departed from each other using code blocks which in python is indentation.
But There are some special blocks which the order of their execution matters. For example When we instantiate a class
the constructor will be called, however there are other blocks that make it a little tricky.

# Static Code Block:
This block is just a block lookalike this:
static {
}
This block is executed whenever ClassLoader Loads the class file in memory. So it means it will only be called only once
till it is available in metadata section of memory. Mostly we use this block to use our static variables

# Initializer Block:
This block is like this:
{
}
This block is called after creation of object but, this is the first thing that executes after calling the super class
constructor in the first line of constructor block. We use this block to write some code which should be executed in
all the constructors in our code. The constructor block will look like this:
Class() {
// super class constructor
// initializer block
// constructor code
}
