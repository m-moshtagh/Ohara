# Sealed Classes

## Overview

Sealed classes are like an addon on inheritance in java. Using this feature we can provide some restrictions on our
inheritance. 

## How to use

We can declare a sealed class using sealed keyword. This will require us to mention the subclass and also the subtype
should extend it and declare if it's final, non-sealed or sealed class.

> Interfaces can also be sealed.
