# Compare interface allows us to implement logic for comparing two Types for example two users. we need to implement
compareTo() method.
The logic is like this:
subject > target -> +1
subject < target -> -1
subject == target -> 0
we just need to return subtraction value of the type that should be compared in the compareTor() method.
