# Reference Types

A reference type refers to an object (an instance of a class).
a reference “points” to an object by storing the memory address where the object is located, a concept referred to as a pointer.

> Java does not allow you to learn what the physical memory address is. only use the reference to refer to the object.

## Asssign value to reference

* A reference can be assigned to another object of the same or compatible type
* A reference can be assigned to a new object using the new keyword

## Differences of Primitives and References

* Referecnce types start with uppercase letter by convention.
* methods can be called following a reference type.
* Reference types can be assigned null. which means they do not currently refer to an object

> Reference size depends on the arch of the system. In 64bit systems reference size is 64 bit and so it is in 32bit systems.
