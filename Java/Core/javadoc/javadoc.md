# Java Doc

---

## Purpose

Javadoc is a tool which comes with JDK, and it is used for generating Java code documentation in HTML format from Java
source code, which requires documentation in a predefined format.

## Usage

We define java doc notation by putting everything between `/** */`. We usually use this on top of the component we want to document.

> We can also use HTML tags.

## Java doc tags

* @author to specify author name
* {@code } to format the text in code format
* @Deprecated to show if the API is deprecated
* @throws | @exception to document the exception which may occur
* {@link } to refer to a documentation of outer class or method
* @param to document parameters of methods
* @return to document what the function is going to return
* @see to refer to a resource
* @since to specify the date or version of the API
* {@value} We can show a constant value using this
* @version to specify the version of the API
