# Object Oriented programming

Object-Oriented is one of the programming paradigms that has been around for a long time which was provided to fix the
issues related to structural style of programming.

Steps:

1. Object-Oriented Analysis(OOA)
2. Object-Oriented Design(OOD)
3. Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)

## Object-Oriented Language

A language which supports These three criteria can be called an Object-Oriented language

* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

## Abstraction

In object-oriented programming, **abstraction** is the process of reducing an object to its essence, so that only the
necessary elements are represented. Abstraction defines an object in terms of its properties _(attributes)_,
behaviors _(functionality)_, and interface(means of communicating with other objects).

> Abstraction is a concept related to OOA & OOD.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of hiding unnecessary details from the User of a component in order to make things simpler.

> Encapsulation is not security protection!

In order to apply encapsulation to code we have these functionalities:

* Access modifiers / Visibility Modifiers
* Mutators & Accessors

creating mutators(setters) & accessors(getters) allow us to:

* prevent invalid state(validation)
* provide synchronized access
* read only
* prevent unnecessary side effects
* Lazy Fetch
