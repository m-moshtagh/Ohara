## Spring MVC

***

### Rest Services

Spring has sets of annotation in order to use rest services.

* First we declare a controller class and mark it with `@RestController` annotation
* > All controller classes Should be under springApplication package to be detected by spring or, we need to define a
  configuration.
    * This annotation is a combination of `@Controller`, `@Documented`, `@ResponseBody` and some more.
    * This annotation converts the output of our methods to JSON.
* We specify `@RequestMapping` in order to map the coming requests to this controller class
    * We pass a URL argument to it.

> It's recommended to specify API version in URL so that we can have multiple versions of it.
> Usually We just include the major number of version however we can add minor number too but,
> it's not recommended including patch number.

* We use `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping` and `@DeleteMapping` to implement our Http methods.
    * We can use {/foo} in order to create dynamic path.
    * We need to also mention ``@PathVariable("foo") Foo bar`` in method signature in order to use path variable.
* In order to return a more detailed object, we can use `ResponseEntity<T>` Which allows us to return HttpStatus object
  too.
    * We can also use `@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus)` on method signature.
    * If we want to wrap something as a header We can use `HttpHeader` type.
* Sometimes we want to bind an object from a form in POST or PUT method. here we need to pass `@RequestBody Foo bar` as
  argument in order to capture the object from request.

### Model Object

In order to send Java objects We can wrap them in model object
and send it with our response. This is accessible by Thymeleaf
In our view templates.
