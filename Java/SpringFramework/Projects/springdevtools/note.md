## Spring boot - developer tools

***

* Auto restart
    * Triggers restart of spring context when a class changes
    * Uses two classloaders: one for app and the other for jar dependencies
    * In eclipse it's triggered via save and in intellij by build
    * By default, templates are cached for performance but this tool disables it, so we can see changes
    * It also includes a liveReload server
