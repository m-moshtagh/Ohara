## H2 In Memory Database

***

### Functionality

H2 can help us a lot in debugging and stuff like that. all we have to do is to add
dependency and enable its console in application.properties. Then
we can access it in `/h2-console` URL. The default jdbc driver
will be logged when we run our application.
