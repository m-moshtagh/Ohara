# Update values in tables

## Syntax

We can update rows with:

```roomsql
UPDATE table_name SET colun_One = 'value', column_two = 'value' WHERE condition
```

## Update multiple records

We can achieve this by changing the condition clause.

> we can use sub queries inside condition too. but we need to use IN keyword.
