# SQL

Structured Query Language is the language we talk to our Database.

## Query:

Basically all the questions we want to ask from database we use query.

`SELECT [IDENTIFIER] FROM [EXPRESSION];`

This is a simple query or clause.

We can use wildcards like * as identifiers.
In SQL, we can use condition in our query with WHERE keyword.

SQL is a Declarative language which we just announce what we need, and we don't care what happens behind the back. But
Imperative programming We just state everything that needs to be done.

### Categories of SQL commands:

- DCL(Data Control Language): We can Grant or Revoke access
- DDL(Data Definition Language): In order to define or modify our structures we use DDL. Commands like Create, Alger,
  Drop, Truncate, Rename and Comment.
- DQL(Data Query Language): In order to retrieve data select is vital.
- DML(Data Modification Language): We use these commands to interact with data inside database. Insert, Update, Delete,
  Merge, Call, Explain Plan and Lock table.

### SELECT:

IN order to retrieve data from database we can use SELECT.

` SELECT [COLUMNS_TO_FETCH] FROM "SCHEMA_NAME"."TABLE_NAME";`

#### Alias:

WE can also select a field and if the name doesn't look cool we can show it with an alias. we use AS keyword.

`SELECT "emp_no" AS "Employee #" FROM "SCHEMA"."TABLE";`

When we use Functions() We lose column name so, We need to declare an alias after the function call in order to show it.

#### DISTINCT:

We can remove duplicate results in select command using DISTINCT keyword.

`SELECT DISTINCT * FROM TABLE;`

### Filtering Data:

In order to answer more complex queries we need to filter them using WHERE clause and combine them with Logical
operators.

```roomsql
select count("gender") from "public"."customers" 
where gender='F' AND (state='OR' OR state='NSY');
``` 

> In order to chain the where clause with conditions we need to be careful with the operator precedence.

To exclude something in our filter we use NOT keyword.

```roomsql
Select count("firstname") from "public"."customers"
WHERE NOT "age" = 55;
```

> We can specify ranges in our where clause using comparison operators.

The operator precedence is like below:

1. parentheses
2. Multiplication / Division
3. Subtraction / Addition
4. Not
5. AND
6. OR

 ```roomsql
SELECT username from "customers"
    where (age < 30
    OR age >= 50) AND "income" > 50000
    AND  ("country"='Japan'
    OR "country"='Australia');
```

#### Checking null values:

Sometimes we might have null values in our record. First we need to make sure that our required data is not nullable.
In order to check the null value we can use IS keyword. This keyword is capable of checking the null and boolean values.
We also have a function named coalesce(column_name, fallback_value) which can replace null values. We can use it on
multiple columns.

SQL has a three valued Logic system which the result may be true, false and null based on the queries filtering.
We need to be careful about null stuff.

#### filter ranges using: BETWEEN x AND y

This is a more convenient way to filter between ranges than using comparison operators.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers c 
	WHERE c.birth_date BETWEEN '1990-1-1' AND '2000-1-1';
``` 

#### IN keyword

Check if a value matches any value in a list of values.
These values are comma separated values inside parentheses.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM employees where emp_no IN (10001, 10003, 11020);
 -- instead of
 -- WHERE emp-no=foo OR emp_no=bar ...
```

```roomsql
SELECT count(orderId) as number_of_orders FROM orders
 WHERE customerId IN (7888, 1082, 12808, 9623);
```

#### filtering using LIKE keyword:

In order to filter what we may partially know we use LIKE keyword.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customerName LIKE 'M%';
```

Patterns is as following:

* %: Any number of characters
* _: One character

Examples:

* LIKE '%2': Fields that end with 2
* LIKE '%2%': Fields that have 2 anywhere in the value
* LIKE '_00%': Fields that have 2 zeros as the second and third character and anything afterward.
* LIKE '2_%_%': Finds any character that start with 2 and are at least 3 characters in length.
* LIKE '2__3': finds any 5 digits number that start with 2 and end with 3.

NOTE: Postgres only uses text for LIKE so, we may need to cast our properties with CAST() function or use :: operator.
CAST(salary AS text); || salary :: text;

NOTE: for insensitive cast we can use LIKE keyword.

> SELECT count( customerId ) FROM customers
> WHERE zip :: text LIKE '%2%'

> SELECT count( customerId ) FROM customers
> WHERE zip :: text LIKE '2_1%'

> SELECT coalesce(state, 'No State') as "State" FROM customers
> WHERE phone::text LIKE '302%';

#### Filtering using REGEXP operator

We can use `REGEXP` instead of `LIKE` and pass regular expression to match String values.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers c 
	WHERE c.first_name REGEXP "ELKA|AMBUR";
```

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers c 
	WHERE c.last_name  REGEXP "EY$|ON$";
```

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers c 
	WHERE c.last_name  REGEXP "^MY|SE";
```

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers c 
	WHERE c.last_name  REGEXP "B[RU]";
```

#### Sort using ORDER BY

We can SORT our result with `ORDER BY` keyword. by default the queries are sorted with PK in ascending order. We can
sort with multiple parameters. In MYSQL we can also filter certain columns but sort them with other columns in table,
however This is not applicable in other databases, you can only sort via columns you have filtered.

```roomsql
SELECT *, quantity * unit_price AS total_price
	FROM sql_store.order_items oi 
	WHERE oi.order_id = 2 ORDER BY total_price DESC;
```

> We can also pass numbers to ORDER BY indicating the columns we have filtered base in precedence. This is not best
> practice because the sorting will change if we modify query.

```roomsql
SELECT name, age FROM person ORDER BY 1, 2 ASC;
```

#### LIMIT queries

We can Limit number of rows in result using `LIMIT` keyword. This LIMIT can optionally accept two numbers that indicate
offset. We can use this in pagination.

For example, we want 1-3 in first page and 3-6 in second and 6-9 in third page. offset should be the number which we
want to skip. for third page we need to pass `LIMIT 6, 3` which ignores first 6 results and shows three next results.

> Formula is: `offset = (pageNo - 1) * NoOfItemsToDisplay`

For pages that need to load more items we can pass a number to LIMIT operator directly.

### Functions:

We have two kinds of functions: Aggregate and Scalar. Aggregate functions take all the data and produce one result. like
sum(). Scalar functions run against each individual record So we get multiple outputs.

- concat():
  We can concat columns or texts using CONCAT() function. We need to pass columns inside "" and text inside '' as
  arguments.

```roomsql
 SELECT concat( "first_name", ' ', "last_name" ) AS "Name" from "public"."employees";
```

- avg()
- min()
- max()
- sum()
- count()

```roomsql
 SELECT max(salary) as "maximum salary", sum(salary) AS "Total paid salaries" From "public"."salaries" ;
```

### Comments:

We can put single line comments with -- at the beginning of the line. We can also use `*/  */` for multiline comments.

## Joins

When we have relationships between our tables for example in customer table we have order_id we can access the other
table's data in our queries using join keyword.

### Inner join

Inner keyword is optional we can only use join and then `ON` with the fields that the join can happen base on them.

```roomsql
SELECT o.order_code, c.customer_name FROM orders o JOIN cutomers c
    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

> If we are joining tables across multiple databases, We need to prefix database name with also aliases.

### Self join

We can also join a table with itself. The syntax is same as above but the different is that we have same database name,
and we need to have different aliases for each of them.
For example, We have employee table that hierarchy of employees is there with column reports_to. We can use self join
to list the manager's name for each person.

```roomsql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, m.employee_name AS manager
    FROM employees e JOIN employees m
    ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
```

#### JOIN more than two tables

```roomsql
SELECT p.payment_id, c.name, pm.name  FROM payments p 
    JOIN clients c ON p.client_id = c.client_id 
    JOIN payment_methods pm ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id;
```

#### Compound join conditions

Sometimes we might have two primary keys in a table. When we want to join this kind of tables we need to provide two
conditions which we call compound join conditions.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM order_items oi JOIN order_item_notes oin
    ON oi.order_id = oin.order_id
    AND oi.product_id = oin.product_id
```

### Implicit JOIN syntax

We have another way to write these joins, and we just use their names in front of `FROM` and we provide the ON statement
in `WHERE` clause.

> It's not recommended to use this syntax.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM products p, orders o
    WHERE p.order_id = o.order_id;
```

### Outer Joins

When we join two tables only records that meet the ON statement condition will be shown. But, if we want to show all
tables from each side we can use LEFT/RIGHT outer joins.

> OUTER keyword is also optional.

```roomsql
SELECT p.product_id, p.name, oi.quantity  FROM products p 
	LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id  = oi.product_id  ;
```

#### Multiple outer joins

```roomsql
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, os.name AS status, s.name AS shipper_name
	FROM orders o 
	LEFT JOIN order_statuses os ON o.status = os.order_status_id 
	LEFT JOIN shippers s ON o.shipper_id = s.shipper_id ;
```

> We can also use self outer join if we want to see all records on individual table.

### USING keyword

Most of the time when we are joining tables, in `ON` statement we provide columns with same names. In these cases we can
only use `USING` keyword and pass the column name to it. This will simplify the syntax. In case of compound primary keys
We can pass columns in it and separate them with comma.

```roomsql
SELECT p.payment_id , c.name  AS client_name, pm.name AS payment_method 
	FROM payments p  
	JOIN clients c USING (client_id)
	JOIN payment_methods pm ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id ;
```

### Natural Joins

MySQL gives us a feature that can join tables automatically base on their similar columns. However, this is not
recommended.

### Cross Joins

This joins every column of one table with other table's columns. We also implicit and explicit syntax for this join.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM payments p CROSS JOIN orders o
```

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM payments, orders;
```

### UNION results

We can combine query results with union keyword.

```roomsql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.points, 'Bronze'
	FROM customers c WHERE c.points < 2000
UNION 
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.points, 'Silver'
	FROM customers c WHERE c.points BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000
UNION 
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.points, 'Gold'
	FROM customers c WHERE c.points > 3000
```

## Complex Queries

### Sub-queries

We can write queries inside SELECT, FROM and WHERE clause to first evaluate the result and pass it to main query.

```roomsql
SELECT * 
	FROM employees e 
	WHERE e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) as average_salary FROM employees e2);
```

We can create a sub-query using the IN operator. Unlike above if the sub-query returns multiple values we need to write
IN keyword.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM clients c
	WHERE client_id NOT IN (
		SELECT DISTINCT client_id FROM invoices i
	);
```

### Sub-Queries vs JOINS

We can rewrite sub queries using JOINS but, sometimes the readability of sub-queries is better but if we see we are
writing a complex sub-query we can use JOINS.

```roomsql
SELECT DISTINCT  c.customer_id , c.first_name , c.last_name  
FROM customers c 
JOIN orders o USING(customer_id)
JOIN order_items oi USING(order_id)
WHERE oi.product_id = 3;
```

```roomsql
SELECT c.customer_id , c.first_name , c.last_name  
FROM customers c WHERE c.customer_id IN (
	SELECT o.customer_id
	FROM order_items oi 
	JOIN orders o USING(order_id)
	WHERE oi.product_id = 3
);
```

#### ALL & ANY keyword

We can use ALL instead of IN if we have the condition on multiple values need to be AND instead of OR.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM invoices i WHERE i.invoice_total > (
	SELECT MAX(invoice_total) FROM invoices i2 WHERE i2.client_id  = 3
)
```

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM invoices i WHERE i.invoice_total > ALL (
	SELECT invoice_total FROM invoices i2 WHERE i2.client_id  = 3
)
```

We can use ANY keyword to filter with any result in sub-query.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM clients c
WHERE c.client_id = ANY (
    SELECT client_id FROM invoices i
    GROUP BY i.client_id
    HAVING count(*) >= 2
);
```

This is equivalent to:

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM clients c
WHERE c.client_id IN (
    SELECT client_id FROM invoices i
    GROUP BY i.client_id
    HAVING count(*) >= 2
);
```

### Correlated Sub-queries

If we reference to a column outside the sub-query (main query) we have a correlated sub-queries. in normal sub-queries
The sub-query executes only once however correlated sub-queries get executed for each main query rows hence, They are
heavier and take more time.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM invoices i 
WHERE i.invoice_total > (
	SELECT AVG(invoice_total) FROM invoices i2 
	WHERE i2.client_id  = i.client_id 
)
```

### Exists operator

If the sub-query result is long and influences the performance We can use EXISTS instead of IN to see if a value is
there or not.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM products p 
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
	SELECT oi.product_id FROM order_items oi
	WHERE oi.product_id = p.product_id 
)
```

Equivalent to:

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM products p 
WHERE p.product_id NOT IN (
	SELECT oi.product_id FROM order_items oi
)
```

### Sub-queries in SELECT clause

```roomsql
SELECT c.client_id, c.name,
(SELECT SUM(i.invoice_total) FROM invoices i WHERE i.client_id = c.client_id) AS total_sum,
(SELECT AVG(i2.invoice_total) FROM invoices i2 ) AS average,
(SELECT total_sum - average) AS difference
FROM clients c ;
```

### Sub-queries in FROM clause

Sometimes we can treat a query as virtual table in memory. For example above query gives us valuable data, and we can
treat it as a separate table.

```roomsql
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT c.client_id, c.name,
  (SELECT SUM(i.invoice_total) FROM invoices i WHERE i.client_id = c.client_id) AS total_sum,
  (SELECT AVG(i2.invoice_total) FROM invoices i2 ) AS average,
  (SELECT total_sum - average) AS difference
  FROM clients c 
) AS total_sales_summary
WHERE total_sales IS NOT NULL;
```

> However, this is recommended for small queries for large queries it's recommended to use views.
