# Stacks:
We use this structure in order to:
- implement undo features
- evaluate an expression
- build compilers
- build navigation

Stacks are LIFO structures. we can only access the top element in stack, so in order to get the last element we have to
take all elements out.

Runtime complexity is O(1) for each operation.

*: whenever we are going for a reverse task, stacks are our best option.
