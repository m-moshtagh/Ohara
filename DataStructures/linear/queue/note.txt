# Queues:
Whenever we want to process a job in order of their creation or arrival we use Queues.

# It is similar to stack but, it's FIFO.

# This interface has lots of implementations but, mostly we use ArrayDeque and LinkedList class.

# We also have PriorityQueues which process items based on their arrival, but based on their priority. for example in
Java's built-in priority queue if we add random integers, when we pop dequeue them we see that they are sorted.
We can implement Priority Queues using Heaps and arrays.
