# Devops introduction

DevOps is the practice of development and operation engineers working together through the entire software development lifecycle following agile principles allowing them deliver software in a rapid and continous manner.

In order to embrace devops we need to:

* Think differently
* Work differently
* Orgenize differently
* Measure differently

## DevOps requirements

DevOps requires:

* A change in culture
* A new application design
* Leveraging Automation
* Programmable platform

DevOps is not:

* Simply combining development with operation
* Not a seperate team
* Not a tool
* Not one size fits all
* Not just automation
