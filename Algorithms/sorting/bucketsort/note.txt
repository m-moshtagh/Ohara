# Bucket Sort:
The idea of this sort algorithm is to distribute this numbers into multiple buckets and sort these buckets using
another sorting algorithm and then combine them. With this approach, instead of sorting a large array, we sort
smaller buckets and, it is much more efficient. Because we can sort them in parallel.

The number of buckets we allocate, will affect the memory usage. we put items in bucket using this formula:
bucket = item / numberOfBuckets
Then we sort each row of bucket and then merge them in main array.
NOTE: each item in our Bucket is a linked list.
Space complexity is O(n + k)
Time complexity:
- Distribution O(n)
- Iterating bucket O(k)
- Sorting O(1)
- Total Best is O(n) worst is O(n^2)
NOTE: more buckets result in linear bud fewer result in n^2
