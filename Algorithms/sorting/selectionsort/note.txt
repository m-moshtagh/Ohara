# Selection Sort:
In this algorithm we divide array in two section:
- Sorted section
- Unsorted Section
We try to find the smallest | largest element on unsorted section and move it to sorted section. We continue this till
the whole array is sorted.

Time complexity is O(n^2) which has poor performance.
