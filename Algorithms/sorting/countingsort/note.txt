# counting Sort:
There are some algorithms that sort our data without comparison.
- Counting Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort
These algorithms use basic math.
This algorithm we create a temp array with range[0, K] which K is the largest element of our array. now we iterate
our array and increment count of each value we interfere. Then at last, we iterate over temp array and put each item
in the main array with their number from lowest to largest.

Space Complexity is O(K) because we need to allocate array based on largest item in array.
Time Complexity:
- Populate counts O(n)
- Iterate counts O(K)
- Total O(n)
NOTE: This algorithm is faster than others so far, but this has memory waste.
When to use:
- Allocating extra space doesn't matter
- Values are positive Integers
- Most of the values in the range are present.
