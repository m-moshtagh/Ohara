# Bubble Sort:
In this sort we try to compare current index with next index and swap them if the first one is bigger. we continue
till we reach end of array, We can see that we moved the largest element to the end of array. we can iterate again
till the array is fully sorted by bubbling larger element up.
In order to boost this algorithm:
- We make sure we don't compare to the sorted part of array next iteration.
- We define an isSorted Flag so if the array is sorted we don't go through all the stuff.

Time complexity:
Best case is O(n), Worst case is O(n^2)
