# Insertion Sort:
This is the algorithm we automatically use when we want to sort cards. we take one card and put it in its appropriate
place.
The technique we use is shifting. we store the index value and compare it with sorted part and, we shift the elements
till we find the correct place.
Time complexity in the best case scenario is O(n) & the worst case scenario is O(n^2). It's like Bubble sort.
