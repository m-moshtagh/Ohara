# Jump Search:
This is an improvement to linear search, but it's not faster than binary search.
We divide the list into few blocks and instead of checking every item we jump to the block where the target may exist
then we'll do a linear search in that block.

The ideal block size is square root of n.
Time complexity is: O(sqrt(n))
