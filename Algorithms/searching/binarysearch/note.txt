# Binary Search:
This is a faster search than linear search but, the array needs to be sorted. We define a middle variable which is
calculated from:
> middle = left + right / 2
we compare till we find our item and replace left and right variables to find our item.
Time complexity is: O(log n)
Space complexity by recursion is O(log n) & by iteration is O(1)
