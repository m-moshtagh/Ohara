# Exponential Search:
The idea is to start with small range and see if the target is in that small range or not.
if not, we need to double the range at each step. once we find the range that item might exist in we'll do a binary
search in it.
We declare a variable called bound and set it to '1'. This is the upper bound of our range which is the last item in
range, and we compare it to our target item. if we didn't find it we double the range and set the bound 2 * '1'.
at last if we find the correct range we do a binary search on range of [bound/2, bound].
Time complexity is: O(log i)
