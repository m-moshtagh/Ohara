# Anagrams:
in order to check if two strings are anagrams, we have two approaches:
- sorting them and compare their equality.
- histogram

In second approach we create an array with 26(english alphabet) indices. Then we iterate first input and increment
the proper alphabet's value. to find index of alphabet we just decrement char from 'a'(97) to find its proper place.
Then we iterate over second input and, we can compare each char with the array but proper way is to decrement value
of array and if the index was 0 we can return false otherwise, it's true.
