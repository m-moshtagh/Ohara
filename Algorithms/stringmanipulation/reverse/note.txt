# reverse String:
we can use a stack or iterate the string backwards.
NOTE: because of String mutability if we try  to append a character to String everytime we are creating a new String
So it's better to use StringBuilder class.
NOTE: Iteration approach is better than stack one.

# reverse word order:
We have three approaches here:
- split() the string, then iterate it in reverse order and append it with whitespace using string builder and return
the trim() version of the result.
- We can use stack
- We can split() the string and use Collections.reverse() method and pass a list to it. At last for space between
words we can use String.join() method.
