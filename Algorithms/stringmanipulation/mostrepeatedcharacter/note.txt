# Finding Most Repeated Character in String:
We can use two Approaches:
- Using a HashMap to store characters and their count.
- Using int array and ASCII table.
The second one is a bit tricky. each character has a numeric value in ASCII table.
We can define an array with size of magic number 256. when try to access array[char] this will
use character's numeric type and point to that place. We can increment the value of it. and at last we can
return the max value.
